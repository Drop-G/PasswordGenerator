# PasswordGenerator

## This assignment was completed to highlight the use of "For loops" and "Arrays". It as shows some competency using math.random functions to modify floating integers to produce a random string by moving through constant variables.

## This also required some understanding how to mamipulate html code through an external script.js document.

## I faced multiple challenges while writing this code. First making the mistake of try to use only "If" statements instead of "for loops". I also struggled to figure out that i need an extra empty string variable to store the password before printing it to the user of the application. 

## I would say moving forward I have a much better understanding how small indexes work and how to move through them. Any applicable math could be fun to create more complicated algorthyms and that I will enjoy.
